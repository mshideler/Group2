Summary
Welcome to the Group 2 dashboard where we explored if there is a relationship between quality of wine and environmental variables such as 
geography, temperature and precipitation.  Based on our analysis, there is no relationship. The R2 value for the Multiple Linear Regression 
model we used is about 33%, which indicates the model isn’t a good fit as can be seen in the charts for Predicted v Actual Ratings by Province 
and Wine Ratings by Region.  The Wine Ratings by Region chart is interactive so that a single province can be viewed at one time instead of 
all provinces at once.  The interactive map shows average temperature, precipitation and pricing for each province analyzed.  Finally, the Wine 
Rating area is also interactive.  Feel free to change province, variety of wine, price, temperature and precipitation and then click the “Predict”
 button to see what wine rating is produced using our model; however, considering the inaccuracy of our model, don’t rely on it as valuable 
information.  We feel the model would be improved with different data such as production levels, quality of grapes, types of grapes, 
and quality of soil.

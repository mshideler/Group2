# Group 2 Wineos

# Topic
The topic of this project is predicting the quality of wine based on environmental factors such as geography, temperature and rainfall.  Climate change is expected to have a dramatic impact on these variables in the future and as enthusiastic wine drinkers, we hope to learn if this will have an impact on our preferred wine growing regions.  Specifically we hope to learn:

- Do higher temps and/or rainfall correlate with higher or lower quality wine?
- What affect will future changes in rainfall and temps have on wine quality from various regions?
- Are new regions poised to emerge as premiere locations for growing grapes and producing wine?

# Data Sources
### Environment Dataset
- https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/download-data
- The world bank provides observed rainfall and temperature data by year for regions within individual countries from 1901 to present.
- Future predictions of the with the same structure are provided which cover the years 2020-2100.
- The data has years in rows and regions in columns.

### Wine Reviews Dataset

- Target variable is the 'points' field.
- Features include 'province', 'region', 'variety' and 'winery'.
